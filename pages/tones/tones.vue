                Tone is the use of pitch in language to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning â€“ that is, to
                distinguish or to inflect words.
            </text>
            <text class="normal-text">
                All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey
                emphasis, contrast, and other such features in what is called intonation, but not all languages use
                tones to distinguish words or their inflections, analogously to consonants and vowels.
            </text>
            <text class="normal-text">
                Languages that do have this feature are called tonal languages; the distinctive tone patterns of such a
                language are sometimes called tonemes, by analogy with phoneme.
            </text>
            <text class="normal-text">
                Tonal languages are common in East and Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Africa, and the Americas; as many
                as seventy percent of world languages may be tonal.
